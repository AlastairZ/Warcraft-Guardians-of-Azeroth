# General Notes and Guidelines

1. If you upload to the repository vanilla things, arts or something not yours, write "#TortoiseDontCount" in the comment!

2. **DO NOT** change other people's lines without asking

3. Don't change province attributes without changing Guardians of Azeroth\map\provinceDef.xls
because the next generation (https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?threads/tutorial-tool-how-to-fill-a-custom-map.697082/) will clear all your changes

4. Make sure that character attributes aren't higher than 25 (35 maximum), because it breaks the balance of the game and isn't supported by most vanilla events

5. CK2 KofA.xml is a language file that can be used in the Notepad++ to help you with the language syntax
      - If you are using Atom editor in conjunction with Git/GitHub Desktop, install the language pack (https://atom.io/package/language-crusader-kings--i-i)
