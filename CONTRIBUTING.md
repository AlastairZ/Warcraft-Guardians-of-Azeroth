Rules for committing changes to the respository:

1. NEVER commit directly to the `master` branch. Always create a new branch upon commit and create a pull request. This
allows us to tag all changes made to the directly and more easily track and control where things are going in and out.
2. DO NOT change other people's lines or code without asking them directly.
3. DO NOT change province attributes without changing Guardians of Azeroth\map\provinceDef.xls. This is because the next
map generation will clear all of your changes. For more information, visit this link:

4. DO NOT make character attributes higher than 30 (40 maximum). Having a higher value than this breaks certain vanilla
events.
