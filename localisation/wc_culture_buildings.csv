wc_human_stables1_desc;A corral devoted to the training and housing of warhorses has been constructed to permanently garrison sturdy mounted knights within this settlement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

wc_human_abbey3_desc;Separate from the primary temple, an isolated abbey has been constructed to better house the more devout worshipers of the area.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
wc_human_abbey4_desc;Perhaps reigning in the most prestige, a grand monastery stands gilded and royal isolated away from most of civilization.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
wc_human_richres1_desc;Magical shops selling enchanted baubles, wands, and enchanting materials have opened throughout the settlement bringing a rather niche market to an otherwise drab marketplace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

wc_orc_tavern4_desc;Orcs, warriors and peons, from all around cheer and howl from the outside of this grand arena as orc champions battle from within its walls.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
