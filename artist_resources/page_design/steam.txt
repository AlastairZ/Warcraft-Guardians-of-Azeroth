"Guardians of Azeroth" is a global mod, based on the Warcraft universe by Blizzard Intertainment. In this mod our team is going to image the world of Azeroth in all its glory, particularly focusing on the story of the classic strategies and World of Warcraft Classic. You will be able to assume the role of one of the human kings or test your luck in the role of conqueror of other worlds! You can restore justice in Azeroth or plunge into the chaos of the Scourge and the Burning Legion. In the end, you can simply turn the whole world into your debtors playing as the goblin' cartels. All decisions are belong to you.

FEATURES:

- Try to create a new Azeroth empire which we have never seen before. For players are available wild tribes of murlocs and gnolls, pygmies of Southern Islands, kobolds and even wolvars of Northrend! Note that it will not be easy to lead these nations to victory.
