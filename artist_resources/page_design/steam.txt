"Guardians of Azeroth" is a global mod, based on the Warcraft universe by Blizzard Entertainment. In this mod our team is going to image the world of Azeroth in all its glory, particularly focusing on the story of the classic strategies and World of Warcraft Classic. You will be able to assume the role of one of the human kings or test your luck in the role of conqueror of other worlds! You can restore justice in Azeroth or plunge into the chaos of the Scourge and the Burning Legion. In the end, you can simply turn the whole world into your debtors playing as the goblin cartels. All decisions are belong to you.

FEATURES:
- All the nations of the four continents of Azeroth are available for playing. You can play anyone: from the usual humans to dwarves of the dark iron clan.
- Try to create a new azerothian empire, which we have never seen before. For players wild tribes of murlocs and gnolls, pygmies of Southern Islands, kobolds and even wolvars of Northrend are available! Note that it will not be easy to lead these nations to victory.
- Prepare for war! You will find many feats of arms. Many special combat units (such as paladins and death knights) will help you to achieve it, as well as your personal skills with sword and magic.
- Players will have access to all classes of the classic World of Warcraft, as well as a few non-standard specialisations like Loa Priests etc.
- Highly detailed map of Azeroth where everyone can find many basic locations of the games. Also the mod includes many regions, which you still cannot find in the MMORPG (Plunder Isle, Tel Abim and more).
- A large number of new traits allowing you to make your game character truly original.
- The possibility to decide the fate of your favourite characters as you want.
