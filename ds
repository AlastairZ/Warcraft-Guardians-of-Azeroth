[33m99c5a8c9[m Pack Form Typo Pack Form gives no Speed.
[33md30e56d9[m Problems and Solutions: - The druid forms were too OP. Even their first levels were better then the vanilla Leadership traits (https://ck2.paradoxwikis.com/Traits#Leadership). The druids could take 2 normal Leadership traits + a druid form and became unbeatable commanders. I have reduced their bonuses by 4 times and gave terrain combat modifiers (more info in the changelog). So I would say the first level forms are on the level of the vanilla Leadership traits. The second level forms are a little better. - The Stag form gave combat bonus to Damage and Morale Damage. It makes no sense to me, so I would change it to Defense and Moral Defense. Here's a quote about the Druids of the Antler that proves that they're not aggressive at all: "Druids of the Antler have rarely let themselves be known to outsiders; like Malorne, they spend most of their time in the wilds".
